AI Fart Generation

This project uses a generative AI model to create fart noises. It takes in prompts and outputs a corresponding fart sound clip.

## Training

The generative AI model was trained on a diverse dataset of real-life fart recordings, collected from various sources. The dataset includes different types of farts such as loud and long, quick and sneaky, multiple toots, and various others. The recordings were made in different environments, such as indoors and outdoors, and with different microphones to capture the nuances and variations in the sounds. The data was thoroughly annotated and labeled to ensure that the model could accurately distinguish between different types of fart sounds. The dataset was also balanced to ensure that the model was exposed to a diverse range of fart sounds and wouldn't over-emphasize any particular type. The goal was to create a model that could generate a wide range of realistic fart sounds, based on a diverse set of training data.

### Data Repositories used in training:
  * Fart Sound Library v1.0
  * The Great Fart Collection
  * Fartitude: A Journey Through Sound
  * The Fart Archive
  * The Noisy Bottom: A Collection of Farts

## How to run
* Clone the repository
* Install required packages listed in requirements.txt
* Run the following command to generate a fart sound: python generate.py "<prompt>"
* Here are some suggestions for prompts I've had good results with:
  * "Beans bubbling in the intestines, releasing a thunderous fart"
  * "A silent but potent wave of gas quietly escapes"
  * "Carbonated soda fizzing and forcing its way out"
  * "A hard-earned fart after a grueling workout, full of pride and satisfaction"
  * "Spicy food ignites a fiery blast from the back end"
  * "A long-pent up fart finally erupts with a satisfying boom"
  * "A rapid-fire series of toots, like a barrage of mini explosions"
  * "A powerful rumble from the belly, unleashing a symphony of flatulence"


## Suggested Uses
